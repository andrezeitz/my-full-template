# My very first website

Welcome to my first website!

This is the first time I build a website in GitPod. It was part of a task in my school.

You can see my website if you follow the link

 ## Project Description

 I created this site to learn more about how to use GitHub, GitPod and Cloud9. It was a lot of fun to code in this new environment but also from time to time challenging.

 ## Technology

 This site was written in HTML and CSS. After that I was using Cloud9 to upload it and is not hosted on a GitHub page.
